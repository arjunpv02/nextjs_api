Next.js API  Integration Project

This project demonstrates the development of APIs using Next.js to interconnect the front-end and back-end. 
The APIs are integrated with a Dash database to handle data exchange between the client and server. 
Tools like Postman and Vue are utilized for testing and visualization of API functionality.

Key Features

	•	Next.js API Development: Built several APIs to connect the front-end and back-end seamlessly.
	•	Dash Database Integration: APIs interact with the Dash database to fetch and store data.
	•	API Testing with Postman: Endpoints are thoroughly tested for performance and accuracy.
	•	Front-End Integration: APIs are used to serve data dynamically to the front-end.
	•	Vue Visualization: Data and API interactions visualized and verified using Vue.js.

Tools & Technologies Used

	•	Next.js: Framework for API development and server-side rendering.
	•	Dash Database: Database solution for managing and storing data.
	•	Postman: API testing and debugging.
	•	Vue.js: Front-end library for visualization and testing.

How It Works

	1.	Developed APIs in Next.js to enable communication between the front-end and back-end.
	2.	Connected APIs to the Dash database to handle data retrieval and storage.
	3.	Tested API endpoints using Postman to ensure functionality and reliability.
	4.	Integrated APIs with the Vue.js front-end to display and validate data flow.
